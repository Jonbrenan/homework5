Day planner


This application serves the user as a day planner. To assist in making plans and timing things out,
the blocks of text change color to determine what the current time is, what the future time is and
fianlly what time has past.

For instance, if the text block is colored red, that means you are in that particular hour. If
the text block is green, it means it is in the future/you have not gotten to this time yet, and finally
if a text box is greyed out, that means that the time has past.

As an added feature, the user can type information into the text blocks. What the user enters is up to them, but it was
intended for the user to plan their day out. Any information can easily be saved into the text block. All the user
has to do is click a particular text block, start typeing, and finally click the save button that is on the right hand
side of the text block. If the user refreshes the page, they will see that their information is still there
(the info previously input shows up again as placeholder text).

The last element I wish to discuss is the fact at the top of the page under the two titles, you will see text that
displays the current time of day (or, to be more precise, the time of the user accessed the page). This information
will update every time the user refreshes or comes to the page.

My motivation for the project is quite simple: I wanted to create a day planner that a individual could use to enter information
that could be saved to help them plan out their day, as well as easily inform the user where they were in the day in respect to the
time.

Creating the actualy elements that appeared on screen was mildy challanging, but what I found gave me the most hardship was
getting the blocks to color up correctly, specifically when a block of text was to display red, as that is what the present time
is.

The last part I had trouble with and what I leanred the most with was making sure that whatever information that was entered would
stay in the text blocks.
